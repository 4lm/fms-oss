life11400:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,010 and was dancing as I could11500:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,150 they combed my hair, put me in a dress11600:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,130 with a golden lining that I

name.12300:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,130 On my way from south to north12400:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,050 Marilyn stayed south12500:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000 and I stayed north12600:16:18,040 -->

--> 00:18:29,140 It wasn't about me anymore13300:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,160 I was just a tiny cell13400:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,200 part of a larger, infinite whole.13500:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,020 Listening to that sound13600:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,200 that makes you sleepy...13700:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,070 the noise of the engines.13800:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,050 It's nice to daydream.13900:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,220 It’s as though the soul abandoned the body.14000:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,090 And suddenly...14100:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,180 you get back to reality.14200:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,180 I would like to return to China,   many times.14300:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,110 See New Zealand again.14400:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,110 And greet these

00:28:12,200 But can you ask from the wind  to blow ceaselessly?14800:28:15,130 --> 00:28:19,200 Can you have day and night   at the same time?14900:28:23,180 --> 00:28:28,050 How can you be a sailor  if you stay in one place?15000:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,190 Then, you would be an immigrant.15100:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,220 Let’s imagine a sailor15200:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,190 crying over his love left in Chile.15300:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,090 If he doesn’t stop crying15400:28:47,130 --> 00:28:53,230 new destinations will lose their meaning.15500:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,130 He must find the courage to leave.15600:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,140 That’s what a seaman does.15700:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,100 He won’t let  the promiscuity of the world15800:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,030 ruin his desire of departure.15900:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,220 He won’t let habit kill the dream.16000:30:38,190 --> 00:30:42,060 Feeling at home in the ocean16100:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,010 is the ultimate challenge.16200:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,170 When you cross the ocean over months16300:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,090 you need to learn to love the people16400:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,010 you meet on its shores.16500:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,190 There is always something new to see.16600:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,210 Always new figures16700:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,170

women17100:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,140 have always something17200:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,210 you already found   in somebody else's arms.17300:31:49,090 --> 00:31:53,170 How could women not be part of all this?17400:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,060 I've become exhausted17500:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,180 going through every word of the song17600:32:32,110 --> 00:32:35,040 each of them holds a memory in my heart...17700:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,010 that I cannot express in writing, but I speak it17800:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,110 aloud.17900:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,140 It's so beautiful.18000:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,110 Whoever might have invented those Greek hairy men18100:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,100 sweet and tender18200:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,190 and with that male

00:33:36,160 remembering19000:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,170 the feel of velvet on my body.19100:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,190 I remember their hairy chests19200:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,010 all those caresses, those hands19300:33:46,050 --> 00:33:48,060 all over my body19400:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,000 invigorating mewith some kind of Greek honey.19500:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,200 How could I forget them?19600:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,190 There’s no need to cry.19700:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200 We should remember what's beautiful.19800:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,080 Maybe they don’t exist anymore19900:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,040 and perhaps I have gone crazy,20000:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,210 out of love.20100:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,150 It seems as if20200:34:13,030 --> 00:34:17,100 my heart had blown up20300:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,090 and was broken to pieces20400:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,180 by most of them.20500:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,170 Yet I still cherish20600:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,020 all those memories.20700:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,220 This is the hour when I get the most nostalgic.20800:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,130 At this hour, I used to wait for my "husbands".20900:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,210 Now I look for them, but I don’t see them.21000:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,100 Or do I?21100:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,200 Maybe I

acted.21500:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,080 But now I can no longer be an actress21600:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,170 ‘cause every word I say comes straight from the heart.21700:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,030 All this pain, this joy...21800:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,010 But I was an artist.21900:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,010 Because I knew how...22000:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,220 to caress a man22100:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,030 and be caressed by him22200:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,010 'cause that's important.22300:36:59,150 --> 00:37:03,170 You can’t be in the presence of a naked body22400:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,140 and remain impervious to it.22500:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,230 You must give and take.22600:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,000 And you tell him:22700:37:21,220 --> 00:37:25,140 "Look how beautiful this is" even if it’s not.22800:37:25,180 --> 00:37:30,010 In the square meter you share with your sailor22900:37:30,110 --> 00:37:33,170 you create the whole universe.23000:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,220 When I dared say to my mother I sold my body23100:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,150 she said: "My girl...23200:37:45,230 --> 00:37:48,090 how can you sell yourself?"23300:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,150 "Each time I take my clothes off...23400:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,180 I pretend to be a mannequin23500:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,020 showing myself as a piece of art."23600:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,020 I don’t see it as something vulgar.23700:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,120 When I receive the money, maybe.23800:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,110 But money makes the world go round.23900:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,220 Doesn't it?24000:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,210 Markos my love24100:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,240 We used to drink, eat, sing...24200:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,160 swear eternal love to each other!24300:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,210 I kept one piece in my pocket!24400:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,010 "Yorgo, you can’t leave me!24500:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,110 I love you!"24600:39:16,010 --> 00:39:20,030 The ship sailed away and I screamed: "No! I want to go with him24700:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,070 I'll throw myself into the water."24800:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,190 "Goodbye, my love! Don’t go away!"24900:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,130 The girls engaged with Greeks25000:39:36,170 --> 00:39:39,070 would throw their ring into the water.25100:39:40,210 --> 00:39:44,050 'Cause the Greeks were constantly buying engagement rings25200:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,110 to avoid having to pay them each time.25300:39:49,130 --> 00:39:53,000 The jeweler got the best profit!25400:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,040 It was true madness for seamen.25500:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,190 The risk of drowning...25600:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,130 We made such scandals on the water!25700:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,110 Girls came from everywhere.25800:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,130 People used to say: "There go the madwomen!"25900:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,180 But the fleeting farewells were only meant for the Greeks.26000:40:32,180 --> 00:40:38,180 With the others, we would merely kiss and hug.26100:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,230 But with the Greeks it was passionate.26200:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,190 It was physical, pure desire!26300:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,160 Such madness...26400:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,190 The day I'll leave this place26500:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,210 I'll erase the word "seaman" from my life.26600:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,180 I don’t want to hear this word ever again.26700:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,060 Sailors are like terrorists.26800:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,210 They arrive in one port26900:41:38,070 --> 00:41:41,200 with a bomb called love27000:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,240 and throw it...27100:41:45,230 --> 00:41:48,090 And you know what happens?27200:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,080 The bomb explodes when they go away27300:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,080 and they never come back.27400:41:58,190 --> 00:42:02,120 As if they arrive on enemy territory27500:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,050 attack, leave and boom: it explodes27600:42:09,050 --> 00:42:13,010 destroying the heart of all the girls in the neighborhood.27700:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,000 How strange...27800:42:19,050 --> 00:42:23,060 To love somebody who pays you.27900:42:52,090 --> 00:42:55,040 Yet again, I was longing for my stars.28000:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,060 I still wanted my ocean.28100:43:03,030 --> 00:43:06,040 I wouldn't be the same if I stayed.28200:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,110 And I would do the same thing.28300:43:18,130 --> 00:43:23,000 I’d go hunting for mermaids again in the middle of the ocean.28400:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,000 Now it's time to be alone.28500:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,160 Good things don’t last long.28600:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,120 It's like getting an electric discharge28700:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,000 that could burn you.28800:44:14,050 --> 00:44:17,150 But when caressed, it feels good28900:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,110 and you end up exhausted, not burned.29000:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,060 That’s the difference with the beautiful things29100:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,190 men leave behind, such as love.29200:44:29,050 --> 00:44:32,090 Pure love, good love.29300:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,120 A man’s body29400:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,090 could be described29500:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,010 as a forest.29600:44:51,070 --> 00:44:52,180 Precious...29700:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,180 aggressive and beautiful.29800:44:55,220 --> 00:45:03,000 A forest has gentle and violent plants29900:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,020 such as a man in sexual trance.30000:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,220 He becomes violent30100:45:12,050 --> 00:45:14,220 like a lion, fierce...30200:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,200 expansive.30300:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,180 He dominates everything.30400:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,090 Women are softer30500:45:30,130 --> 00:45:32,030 more shy.30600:45:39,130 --> 00:45:41,040 It’s wonderful30700:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,240 and you don’t want the night to end.30800:45:45,140 --> 00:45:49,030 You say to yourself: "This is the man I want."30900:45:50,170 --> 00:45:54,120 But the next morning, the guy gets up and leaves.31000:45:55,180 --> 00:45:58,180 Then you realize us women31100:45:58,220 --> 00:46:02,030 are meant to be taken and left behind.31200:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,000 Hair can speak.31300:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,180 We rarely feel our hair.31400:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,020 And it’s so important...31500:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,210 It reminds you of...31600:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,230 so many moments in your life.31700:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,060 The hands...31800:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,240 of those men who used to caress your hair...31900:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,200 Us women don't often32000:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,120 pay attention to our hair.32100:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,140 We mistreat it.32200:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,050 But our hair is like the ornament of life32300:46:52,090 --> 00:46:55,050 the mirror to a woman’s face32400:46:56,140 --> 00:46:59,010 embellishing her like a flower.32500:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,230 Hair.32600:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,200 These days it's a bit neglected32700:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,180 'cause it’s expensive to keep it nice.32800:47:09,150 --> 00:47:11,190 But I have always loved my hair.32900:47:11,230 --> 00:47:15,200 The Greeks used to caress it and say...33000:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,060 "Oraio koukla mou!"33100:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,130 "Oraio matia mi koukla mou!" meaning I had beautiful eyes.33200:47:25,170 --> 00:47:28,040 Now, wrinkles is all that’s left.33300:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,080 Anyway...33400:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,230 Look at the little birds out there.33500:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,220 Look at what's left of a woman’s body33600:47:49,010 --> 00:47:51,110 after having fought against the sailors.33700:47:53,190 --> 00:47:56,050 Look at what’s left of their gazelle.33800:47:56,090 --> 00:47:57,150 Bitten...33900:47:57,190 --> 00:48:00,110 not by a dog, but by man.34000:48:00,220 --> 00:48:04,080 Caressed and destroyed by man.34100:50:41,130 --> 00:50:43,060 Happy Easter!34200:53:21,100 --> 00:53:27,210 Life is a warm river34300:53:28,130 --> 00:53:31,140 and we swim in it34400:53:31,180 --> 00:53:34,120 thinking we are eternal.34500:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,120 But...34600:53:39,170 --> 00:53:43,160 we follow the laws of biology.34700:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,010 It's so vulgar34800:53:46,050 --> 00:53:48,210 so unfair  and it hurts so much34900:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,230 but that’s the way it is.35000:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,090 All these years35100:54:10,240 --> 00:54:14,000 I accumulated feelings, images35200:54:14,110 --> 00:54:16,090 and some knowledge.35300:54:18,220 --> 00:54:21,120 Now, I accept the wear.35400:54:21,210 --> 00:54:24,030 The wear of time.35500:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,190 But...35600:54:37,130 --> 00:54:40,190 chasing the dream35700:54:40,230 --> 00:54:44,030 was always on my mind.35800:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,100 And so life went by.35900:54:54,090 --> 00:55:00,070 A whole life to confirm something so simple.36000:55:02,120 --> 00:55:05,030 We are living a miracle.36100:57:27,030 --> 00:57:30,070 I wish I had children.36200:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,060 Many children.36300:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,090 A whole collection of them.36400:57:42,190 --> 00:57:45,040 But God didn’t want it that way.36500:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,100 They may have had different fathers.36600:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,110 They may have had multiple skin colors36700:57:52,150 --> 00:57:54,190 but they would have been mine.36800:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,210 It’s tough36900:58:00,030 --> 00:58:01,170 to think of it.37000:58:03,020 --> 00:58:07,160 Because us who couldn't conceive a child37100:58:09,170 --> 00:58:12,050 we are sort of empty in life.37200:58:14,090 --> 00:58:17,210 That's why whenever I am around sailors37300:58:18,190 --> 00:58:20,160 and I see them so young37400:58:21,220 --> 00:58:25,050 I think they could be my men's children37500:58:25,090 --> 00:58:27,070or their grandchildren.37600:58:27,110 --> 00:58:29,050 And I see them so...37700:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,050 so...37800:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,030 drunk, in the night37900:58:35,210 --> 00:58:38,240 trying to buy a moment of happiness38000:58:39,090 --> 00:58:41,120 and I think to myself: "History repeats itself38100:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,170 throughout generations."38200:59:03,130 --> 00:59:07,090 I tried to quit drinking due to my condition...38300:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,160 the tumors men gave me38400:59:12,070 --> 00:59:15,080 because of how much they loved me.38500:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,210 Maybe they didn’t want to let go of me.38600:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,150 They held me so tight, I didn’t realize they hurt me.38700:59:24,140 --> 00:59:29,240 Thus I thank God I can remember38800:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,200 so many nice things.38900:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,060 Mostly nice things.39000:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,050 I even turned misfortune into happiness39100:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,160 so I could move on39200:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,240 and be able to help others who might need39300:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,070 some words of encouragement39400:59:52,220 --> 00:59:55,050 from an unfortunate woman of the night39500:59:55,150 --> 00:59:58,040 ran aground on the shore39600:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,240 like an old ship, rusted...39701:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,090 and damaged.39801:00:07,200 --> 01:00:12,130 I don’t think it was the blows but all the squeezing...39901:00:12,170 --> 01:00:13,240 Look at my neck40001:00:14,030 --> 01:00:17,180 filled with tumors, my arms...40101:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,220 Oh Lord40201:00:24,010 --> 01:00:27,110 was it when I held Nicos or Babis, or Simon...?40301:00:29,060 --> 01:00:33,130 I squeezed half Athens, half Piraeus with these arms!40401:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,030 I don’t know...40501:01:03,150 --> 01:01:06,120 In fact, the tumors are all over my body.40601:02:44,210 --> 01:02:48,020 Have you ever imagined a never-ending life?40701:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,010 How would it be?40801:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,100 Have you ever conceived of a life without pain40901:03:06,010 --> 01:03:07,220 without passion41001:03:09,020 --> 01:03:10,240 or loss?41101:03:13,030 --> 01:03:15,030 Really, how would we be?41201:03:26,080 --> 01:03:30,120 A life where order and security would prevail?41301:03:31,100 --> 01:03:34,200 A life where all the roads go straight?41401:03:39,140 --> 01:03:43,230 Without passion, pain nor anxiety 41501:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,170 the drama never ends.41601:03:48,020 --> 01:03:51,120 Imagine our lives without drama.41701:03:52,030 --> 01:03:53,150 How would we be?41801:03:53,190 --> 01:03:57,020 Like wheat stalks in a field, all the same.41901:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,150 One day someone mows them down 42001:04:00,190 --> 01:04:02,230 and that’s the end of the story.42101:04:10,010 --> 01:04:13,120 The world needs passion
